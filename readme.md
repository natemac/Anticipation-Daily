- Users can create custom puzzles with their own category names using the builder

### JSON Structure

The JSON format has been simplified to:

```json
{
  "name": "ITEM_NAME",
  "categoryName": "Category Display Name",
  "dots": [
    { "x": 210, "y": 105 },
    { "x": 350, "y": 105 }
  ],
  "sequence": [
    { "from": 0, "to": 1 }
  ]
}
```

## Audio System

The game features a comprehensive audio system designed to enhance the gameplay experience:

### Background Music
- Each category has its own unique background music that matches the theme:
  - **Yellow**: Ambient music with a journey feel
  - **Green**: Playful, appetizing soundtrack
  - **Blue**: Modern, technological soundscape
  - **Red**: Relaxed, fun atmosphere music
- Music continues playing throughout the gameplay but lowers volume during guessing
- The system remembers playback position per category when switching between them

### Sound Effects
- **Correct Input**: Plays when the player enters a correct letter
- **Incorrect Input**: Plays when the player makes a wrong guess

    // Visual settings
    DOT_RADIUS: 5,                // Size of dots on the grid

    // Gameplay settings
    GUESS_TIME_LIMIT: 10,         // Seconds for guessing
    HIDE_INITIAL_MESSAGES: true,  // Hide any messages at game start

    // Hint system
    HINT_COOLDOWN_TIME: 5,        // Cooldown time in seconds between hints
    HINTS_AVAILABLE: 0,           // Number of hints available per game (0 = unlimited)

    // UI settings
    WRONG_MESSAGE_DURATION: 800,  // Duration to show wrong messages (milliseconds)
